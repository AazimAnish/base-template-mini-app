# SUS Game - Deployment Summary

## ✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED & CONFIGURED

### Smart Contract
- **Contract Address**: `0x45D8421807A9C88dac321aE0245540dA579d5703`
- **Network**: Base Sepolia Testnet
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and Verified
- **Features**: 
  - Dynamic stake amounts set by game host
  - Full game lifecycle (lobby → game → voting → end)
  - Real pot management and distribution
  - Secure role assignment and voting

### Application Status
- **Frontend**: ✅ Fully Functional
- **Contract Integration**: ✅ Complete - No Mock Data
- **Real-time Updates**: ✅ Polling every 3 seconds
- **Wallet Connection**: ✅ Base Sepolia ready

## 🎮 GAME MECHANICS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Lobby Creation
- Host sets custom stake amount (e.g., 0.0001 ETH)
- Real contract call to `createGame(lobbyId, stakeAmount)`
- Dynamic lobby ID generation

### 2. Joining Games
- Players join with exact stake amount
- Real contract call to `joinGame(gameId)` with ETH value
- Automatic balance and game state updates

### 3. Game Flow
- **Start Game**: Host initiates with `startGame(gameId)`
- **Role Assignment**: Contract randomly assigns Imposter/Crew
- **Rug Mechanism**: Imposter can call `rug(gameId)` to steal pot
- **Voting System**: Players call `startVote()` and `vote(gameId, playerIndex)`
- **Automatic State Transitions**: Contract manages all state changes

### 4. Win Conditions
- **Imposter Victory**: Successfully rugs → Takes full pot
- **Crew Victory**: Votes out Imposter → Shares pot equally

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

- startGame(gameId) ✅
- rug(gameId) ✅
- startVote(gameId) ✅
- vote(gameId, playerIndex) ✅
- getGameState(gameId) ✅ (with polling)
- getPlayerRole(gameId, address) ✅
```

### No Mock Data
