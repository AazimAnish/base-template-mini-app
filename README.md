# SUS - Social Deduction Game on Base

A multiplayer social deduction game built as a Base Mini App where players stake ETH and try to identify the Traitor among them.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**SUS** is a high-stakes social deduction game where:
- Players stake real ETH to join games
- 1 player is secretly assigned as the Traitor

- ‚úÖ Mobile-first responsive design
- ‚úÖ Frame metadata for Farcaster integration
- ‚úÖ Real ETH staking via smart contracts
- ‚úÖ Real-time multiplayer gameplay
- ‚úÖ Automatic pot distribution

## üéØ How to Play

### Game Flow
1. **Create/Join Lobby**: Set stake amount and max players
2. **Wait for Players**: Share lobby ID with friends  
3. **Role Assignment**: Secretly receive Crew or Traitor role

## üîó Smart Contract

The game uses a custom escrow smart contract deployed on Base:
- **Secure ETH Staking**: Players stake ETH to join games
- **Automatic Payouts**: Winners automatically receive their share
- **Rug Protection**: Only verified traitors can rug the pot
- **Emergency Withdrawals**: Timeout protection for abandoned games

### Contract Features
- Multi-player game lobbies
- Stake amount validation (0.001 - 1 ETH)
- Automatic role assignment verification
- Secure pot distribution
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **ShadCN UI**: Component library
- **Zustand**: Client-side state management
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management

### Blockchain Stack
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development
- **Hardhat**: Development environment
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum
- **Viem**: TypeScript Ethereum client
- **Base Network**: Layer 2 blockchain

### Real-time Stack
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication
- **Redis** (optional): Message persistence
- **WebSocket**: Low-latency updates

## üö¢ Deployment

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet):**
   ```bash
   bun run deploy:sepolia
   ```

2. **Deploy to Base Mainnet:**
   ```bash
   bun run deploy:mainnet
   ```

3. **Verify on BaseScan:**
   ```bash
   bun run verify --network base <contract-address>
   ```

### Frontend Deployment

Deploy to Vercel (recommended):

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Farcaster Frame Setup

1. Deploy to a public URL
2. Generate Farcaster manifest using custody wallet
3. Submit to Farcaster for frame approval
4. Share frame link in casts

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run smart contract tests
bun run test

# Run frontend in development
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Type checking
bun run type-check

# Linting
bun run lint
```

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The app is built mobile-first with:
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Swipe gestures for voting
- Safe area insets for notched devices
- Progressive Web App features

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Security**: Audited escrow logic with reentrancy protection
- **Private Key Safety**: Never expose private keys in frontend
- **Role Assignment**: Server-side verification prevents cheating
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam in chat and voting
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated

## üé® Game Design

### Visual Design
- Dark theme with red/black color scheme
- High contrast for accessibility
- Animated role reveals and game transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy for important actions

### User Experience  
- Intuitive lobby creation and joining
- Real-time updates without page refreshes
- Clear game state indicators
- Mobile-optimized chat interface
