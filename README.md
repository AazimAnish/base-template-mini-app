# SUS - Social Deduction Game on Base

A multiplayer social deduction game built as a Base Mini App where players stake ETH and try to identify the Traitor among them. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and deployed on Base blockchain.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**SUS** is a high-stakes social deduction game where:
- Players stake real ETH to join games (0.001 - 10 ETH)
- 1 player is secretly assigned as the Traitor
- Crew members win by eliminating the Traitor through voting
- Traitors win by surviving all rounds OR by rugging the entire pot
- Winners split the ETH pot automatically via smart contracts
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay with Socket.io
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for Farcaster Mini Apps
