# SUS - Onchain Social Deduction

A multiplayer onchain social deduction game inspired by Among Us, built as a Base Mini App for Farcaster.

## Game Overview

SUS is a lightweight Among Us-style social deduction game where:

- **Players** join a lobby via wallet and pay an entry fee (0.001 ETH)
- **Roles** are randomly assigned: Crew or Imposter (1 Imposter per game)
- **Imposter** can "rug" (steal the pot) anytime to win
- **Crew** can vote to eject suspects. If they eject the Imposter, they win and share the pot
- **Entry Fee**: 0.001 ETH per player
- **Players**: 3-10 per game

## User Flow

1. **Landing** → Connect wallet → Create/Join lobby
2. **Lobby** → Pay entry fee → Wait for game start
3. **Playground** → Discuss → Rug (Imposter) or Vote (All)
4. **Vote** → 30-second voting period → Eject player
5. **End Game** → Role reveal → Winnings distribution

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React + Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Blockchain**: Base (Sepolia testnet)
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity (OpenZeppelin)
- **Wallet**: Wagmi + OnchainKit + MiniKit
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Farcaster Frame SDK (deferred auth)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Farcaster account for testing

### Local Development

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd sus-onchain-social-deduction
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Environment variables** (create `.env.local`):
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_coinbase_api_key
   # Optional: Neynar API for advanced features
   NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key
   NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Test in Warpcast**:
   - Open [Warpcast Mini App Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers)
   - Enter `http://localhost:3000` in the Preview Tool
   - Click "Preview" to test the Mini App

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Deploy to Base Sepolia**:
   ```bash
   # Using Remix IDE
   1. Copy contracts/SUSGame.sol to Remix
   2. Compile with Solidity 0.8.19+
   3. Deploy to Base Sepolia network
   4. Update SUS_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS in src/lib/susContract.ts
   ```

2. **Contract verification**:
   ```bash
   # On Basescan Sepolia
   npx hardhat verify --network base-sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
   
   # Deploy
   pnpm run deploy:vercel
   ```

2. **Update Farcaster Mini App**:
   - Register at [Farcaster Developer Portal](https://warpcast.com/~/developers)
   - Submit Mini App with production URL
   - Include manifest.json for proper integration

## Game Mechanics

### Entry Fee & Economics

- **Stake Amount**: 0.001 ETH (adjustable in contract)
- **Rationale**: Low enough for casual play, high enough to create meaningful stakes
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimal state changes, efficient voting mechanism

### Role Assignment

- Random assignment using `block.prevrandao` for entropy
- 1 Imposter per game regardless of player count
- Role revealed only to individual players

### Win Conditions

1. **Imposter Victory**: Execute rug → Take entire pot
2. **Crew Victory**: Vote out Imposter → Share pot equally among alive crew
3. **Stalemate**: Time limits prevent infinite games (future enhancement)

### Security Considerations

- No sensitive data logged or exposed
- Entry fees held in contract until game resolution
- Votes are irreversible once submitted
- Host cannot manipulate game outcomes

## Development Notes

### MVP Limitations

- **Chat**: Placeholder only (recommend external voice/video chat)
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based (could be upgraded to WebSockets)
- **Contract Address**: Placeholder until deployment
- **Randomness**: Basic on-chain randomness (suitable for MVP)

### Future Enhancements

- Real-time chat integration
- Advanced role mechanics (multiple imposters, special roles)
- Tournament/league functionality
- NFT collectibles for wins
- Cross-chain deployment
- Mobile-optimized UI improvements

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Wallet connection (Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask)
- [ ] Lobby creation and joining
- [ ] Entry fee payment
- [ ] Game start with proper role assignment
- [ ] Rug functionality (Imposter)
- [ ] Voting mechanism (all players)
- [ ] Proper fund distribution
- [ ] Farcaster sharing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Known Issues

- Contract address needs updating after deployment
- Some UI components need variant prop fixes
- Vote timing could be more precise with WebSocket updates

## Deployment Status

- **Smart Contract**: ⏳ Ready for deployment to Base Sepolia
- **Frontend**: ✅ Deployed locally, ready for production
- **Farcaster Integration**: ✅ Mini App compatible
- **Testing**: ⏳ Local testing completed, testnet testing pending
